	Purpose:
		-Demonstrate the ability to upload a file from a website onto our Node server (ideally images).
	
	Usage:
		-Go to app.js and change this to your appropriate absolute project file path.
			var projectFilePath = '/Users/Mochi/15-237/DemoFileUpload/';
		-Run the node server:
			node app
		-Make sure there's an 'images' folder in the same directory as app.js
		-Try it
		
	Bugs:
		-Works for .jpg, and .pdf files. Weird problems when .exe is uploaded.
	
	Technologies Required:
		HTML5
			jquery
				Any version > 1.7.0 will definitely work.
				Either download a 'jquery-1.9.0.js' file or include it straight from google api's    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
			JQUERY FORM PLUGIN!!!!
					http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
					Either download from github or include it straight from github:
					<script src="http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js"></script> 
				Requirements: Assumes jquery preloaded.
		Node.js
			express
				Obtain via 'npm install express'

	Relevant Code: Mostly ALL of it is taken from http://markdawson.tumblr.com/post/18359176420/asynchronous-file-uploading-using-express-and-node-js
	with a few minor tweaks.
		index.html
			We need to use <form>s for fileuploads. This submits to the node server via an http POST request. 
				enctype - specifies the type of POST request. 
					POST requests are split into 2 types:
						application/x-www-form-urlencoded (default)
						multipart/form-data
				action - specifies the path on which the form gets submitted.
					In Node.js, this is the specified route:
					If I say action = '/api/photos', that means the route is:
					app.post('/api/photos', function(request, response) {....
		fileupload.js
			Some tricky code used to accept the input. This is where the JQUERY FORM PLUGIN is used. Specifically:
				$(this).ajaxSubmit(...
			The API is on: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/	
		app.js
			Code in app.post('/api/photos', function(req, res) ...
			The file is automatically saved somewhere on the node server. It's accessible via:
				request.files.<input name field>.path
